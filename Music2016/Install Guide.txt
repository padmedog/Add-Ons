To avoid any confusion this year, I've decided to make an install guide for these loops.

/DO NOT/ copy the Install Guide file into the Music directory for blockland.

NON STEAM
1. Extract the files into Documents\Blockland\Add-Ons\Music

STEAM
1. (Drive Letter)\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Blockland\Add-Ons\Music

FAQ:
Q. Do I need to make a music_long folder this year?
A. No, this all goes in the music folder because we decided to work with blocklands loop limitations.

Q. Will we provide a cache.db file?
A. Yes, read the "Download" section of the thread.

Q. Do I need to keep the old loops?
A. We're not using all of the old loops, so no. These include a few loops from years before, though.

Q. Am I allowed to use these loops on other servers?
A. Sure!
